This is my task submission of Alexa Developers Community CU for position of Web Developer.
I have used Firebase Auth feature for setting backend authentication in this task.
At first user have to sign Up for saving its data and logging in using same credentials and Forgot password feature can be used using registered email id for updating password by email authentication..
And even after several failed attempts of wrong password it temporarily disable the user account and to retrieve it user have to reset password.
